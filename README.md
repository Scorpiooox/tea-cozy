# tea-cozy
Codecademy's project to build a responsive website off-platform.


The Tea Cozy site is a fictional tea shop website, which is meant to showcase flexbox containers and manipulating these boxes using CSS. This training project, prepared by Codecademy has been an invaluable exercise in enhancing my skills on the application of CSS flexbox.
